# LocalHost_HappySocialMedia_WebApp
  I/ INTRODUCTION

In recent years, with the development of society and information technology, the internet and social networking sites have had a great influence on all aspects of people's daily life. In particular, social media network gives people many conveniences such as instantly information, various types of contents and also allows them to connect, exchange, share stories, personal ideas and activities over the network. Hence, our team, as a group of students from RMIT University, have decided to build a simple Happy Social Media web application for users to express their feelings and thoughts on the platform. This web can allow users to create an account to sign in to the home page by using individual email and be able to post stories on the main page as well as like, comment on other user's posts. 

This is the final project of Enterprise Application Development course in RMIT University.

Then, you can create a React application by installing the create-react-app via your terminal by running the command "npm install -g create-react-app". Finally you can create a project based on React with this command "npx create-react-app myfirstreact" in the terminal (myfirsreact is example for the name of the project).
